# Design-and-control-of-a-robotic-arm-for-handling-objects-using-image-processing
This is a short description of my thesis

Designed and developed a prototype of an industrial robot controlled by identifying the position of objects, and utilized Solid Works for 3D modeling,
Python image processing with Arduino IDE for control, and MATLAB for simulations.
- in collaboration with Conf.dr.ing. Sergiu-Dan STAN

    Design and control of a robotic arm for handling objects using image processing
    


    The present paper aims at the study of industrial robots and the development of a prototype that is subsequently controlled with the help of the process
of identifying the positions of objects.
    Chapter 1 presents a brief introduction to mechatronics, a brief description of industrial robots and justifies the choice of project theme.
    Chapter 2 presents generalities of industrial robots and their applications in industry, as well as their history and the evolution they have gone through
since the beginning of their development. The basic components of industrial robots were also presented.
    Chapter 3 represents the design of the prototype of the robot to be made. The kinematic modeling of the robotic arm is presented, together with its direct 
and inverse kinematics. Also, in chapter 3 is presented the simulation of the prototype in MATHHLAB using the extension "Robotics Toolbox". Also, in chapter 3 are 
presented the steps to be followed for assembling the robot.
    The electronics and control of the robot are approached in chapter 4 where the components used as well as the connections of the components are presented.Also,
in chapter 4 is presented the control of the mechanism and simple details about the program used.
    Chapter 5 presents the prototype made in the paper, describes the actual realization process of the robot using the 3D throughput process, as well as the 
control of the robot using image processing.
    The end of the paper is the main conclusions that are presented in Chapter 6, as well as the advantages and disadvantages encountered in the design and 
control of the prototype.
